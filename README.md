# DALL-E 3 Image Generator

Welcome to the open-source repository for the DALL-E 3 Image Generator! This project is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and allows you to generate images using the DALL-E 3 model by OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- A package manager like npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

Additionally, you will need an API key from OpenAI to use the DALL-E 3 model.

## Setup

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/peteracs/dall-e-3-next-js-template.git
cd dall-e-3-next-js-template
npm install
# or
yarn install

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
````

Replace `sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your actual API key.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

## Editing the Application

You can start editing the application by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
